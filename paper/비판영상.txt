zoran Mandani a self-described Democratic socialist who won the primary in the race to become the next mayor of New York has made addressing the city's housing crisis his signature issue with New York apartments costing about twice the national average this pathy slogan has become a rallying cry for housing activists freeze the rent free the rent free the rent they're demanding that the government take aggressive steps to deal with the city's exploding housing costs housing is a human right housing is a human right and you got to fight as you can see tenants make up a majority of this city for the past few months I've been going to these rallies while working on a documentary about the city's housing crisis could we talk to you for a minute or would any of you be interested in doing a quick interview I'm not talking all right hey I'm Hey nice to meet you justin justin where you from Oh yes our libertarian friends are you looking to get an interview as well Yes he's got to work the crowd for a bit but I'm sure we can find a little time okay sit tight i'll get it okay thank you m Dani who slipped out of the venue before I could talk to him would appoint the members of the New York City Rent Guidelines Board if he becomes mayor it has the power to freeze the rent for about a million apartments under the current mayor Eric Adams the board has allowed rents to go up by an average of about 3% a year or less than the rate of inflation our proposal fuel 19.9% it's turned into a circus and Cchac who's the board president of the Small Property Owners of New York is one of the few landlords who attend these public meetings booing and hissing it's really very intimidating many of the people who come out to these rallies live in rent regulated apartments meaning they're already protected from the city's soaring housing costs but what about the people who don't already live in one of these apartments who don't typically come out to rallies or get interviewed on TV How do policies like freeze the rent impact them We've been down on our luck for quite some time i've been pawning off all my stuff just to raise extra money julian Costa and his partner Zena have been struggling to find an affordable place to live in New York but there are fewer apartments on the market than ever before any good apartment that we saw there is a line of 20 30 40 50 people already applying as well julian who works as an acupuncture assistant never gets picked i tried to go to several places that we could afford and the landlord said the same thing they're looking for the highest income for the software engineer that makes six figure salaries advocates for rent regulation say these laws are necessary to protect the poor and working class but there's no income limit for living in a rent regulated apartment and in practice the wealthy and privileged often get the best deals hi I'm a software engineer and you guys are currently in my rent stabilized apartment it's the golden apartment because the apartment is rent regulated Tyler pays only $1,900 a month which is less than half the market rate i am that 1% who got the perfect apartment in the great city of New York while tenants like Julian and Zena might benefit more from such a deal from the landlord's perspective Tyler's high income makes him a safer financial bet that extra $600 $700 I'm saving is going towards retirement it's going for a down payment for a house in the future or a co-op it's a subsidy of life effectively you see sometimes those you know tech bros with $300,000 incomes should they be in the unstabilized departments Absolutely not there should be someone else who deserves them more i come from Europe and when I learned that rent stabilized apartments are not given to people based on their income but it's just a matter of luck I was really shocked emanuel Welch is a private investigator and fraud examiner in New York City even in France they don't have laws that are like this it's the wealthiest tenants who maybe live full-time in Miami or in the Hamptons we had a case of a man who was living in Pennsylvania in a beautiful house but he would keep his apartment rent controlled near Yankee Stadium so that he could go to the games and not pay for a hotel it's a very New York situation where having a a rent stabilized apartment is cursive as an asset rent regulated tenants lucky enough to reside on Manhattan's Upper West Side enjoy some of the steepest discounts in the city the neighborhood is known for its massive pre-war apartment buildings and elegant town houses they were grand beautiful brownstones for wealthy doctors lawyers bankers landlords like Horch will sometimes have the same family occupying one of their units for generations although rent regulated tenants don't own their apartments the law makes it possible for them to pass their units down to their children or grandchildren the New York Times and CNBC told the story of a young influencer who inherited a regulated two-bedroom near Central Park renting way below market i just feel super lucky i would be insane to give it up but I would love to keep it for my kids one day if you've got hold of one of these lottery tickets right which is what a rent stabilized apartment is you know you don't give it up you don't give it up it's rent stabilized rent stabilized everybody know what that means When you rent the rent stabilized apartment it is almost as though you own the place if we are making sure that people get to stay in their rented units for generation after generation that we are not making space for people who would like to come to New York and find a brighter future edward Glazer who the Wall Street Journal has called America's leading economist of urban life is an economics professor at Harvard this is a common fact throughout the world that urbanization is associated with prosperity and indeed cities are about change and they are about being great places to start often with nothing and if we're going to say that the only way you get a cheap apartment in New York is that your grandparents rented it in 1947 at a dirt cheap price that's a terrible way to make sure that our cities are inclusive for all julian's partner Zena who just completed her degree in cosmetics grew up in New York unfortunately I didn't have the most stable parents my dad was also someone that was kind of in and out of my life passed away when I was 16 when I turned 21 I ended up kind of being homeless at that point we try to be as self-sufficient as we can and it's kind of sad like we don't get that safety net you don't get that footing i definitely see myself keeping it as my primary residence forever the young influencer who's saving money on her rent regulated apartment managed to buy a country house in Vermont a process that she has chronicled on her YouTube channel hey ho ho hey ho ho but what about workingclass families who still occupy the majority of rent regulated apartments in New York Many can't afford a market rate unit because the median cost of a one-bedroom is about $4,400 a month so without rent regulation and freeze the rent wouldn't everyone who isn't rich be forced to leave the city As a home care worker I pay over 30% of my wages on rent if the rent goes up again people will suffer we shouldn't have to choose between medication and rent people can't afford this it's impossible but Glazer says rent regulation is one of the main reasons it's so hard to find an affordable place to live in New York rents are artificially high because you've taken all these other units off the market rent control leads to misallocation of units middle- inome couples who come to New York with a kid hoping to find a future in the city are priced out because there's somebody who's using the unit as a pedair if you did raise a family in a big apartment and now your children are grown you don't need a three-bedroom apartment anymore but you know where are you going to go right So there's a mismatch of housing to the occupants too because of rent stabilization it really distorts the market you don't want to screw up markets every time we try to turn off the price mechanism there's going to be a strange way in which people are going to try and work around it and you can't just keep on whacking a mulling because all sorts of strange and awful things happen rent regulation has caused all sorts of strange and awful things in New York's real estate market since it was first imposed over a century ago the most tragic case dates to the 1970s when rent control was one of a handful of policies that caused the annihilation of the South Bronx as economist Assar Lindbeck famously put it rent control appears to be the most efficient technique presently known to destroy a city except for bombing some landlords torched their buildings to collect the insurance money because their rent rolls weren't enough to cover their expenses the fire next door cbs reports with Bill Moyer this is the Bronx in New York and the flames are the signal of a national disaster a couple put their life savings into their building a rent control law left over from World War II kept a ceiling on rents losing money they let the building decline more and more apartments become vacant and it becomes less profitable for the landlord and before you know you have a park that uh no one lived in it's uh becomes a waste after the South Bronx was rebuilt with help from local and federal housing programs New York lawmakers passed a series of bills weakening rent regulation in hopes of ending the market distortions rent control provisions that have existed for 30 years have been detrimental to working people to middle class people to poor people so I think it's important that we bring about a change cut to 2019 when a new generation of progressive politicians that would later include Zoran Mandani took control of New York state government and passed a bill that undid those reforms turning New York's rent regulation laws once again into the most stringent in the nation there had been a Republican majority in the state senate for decades a lot of the anti-Trump vote in 2018 turned many of those long-held Republican seats to Democrat this purpose has long been obstructed in New York because of various mechanisms to privilege profits over people then Governor Cuomo had said "Well I'll sign whatever you put on my desk." The two houses came to an agreement and said "Okay Governor we've made this agreement this is what we want." And he signed it the strongest tenant protections in the history of New York State we are going to look back six years now there will be no more displacement disenfranchisement but 6 years later the 2019 law has made New York City's housing crisis worse landlords aren't burning down their buildings to collect the insurance money but there are parallels to what happened in the South Bronx building owners are keeping properties off the market and allowing them to fall into disrepair because prices are set too low to cover their costs these apartments like mothball right You know they're like a ship that can't sail anymore seems foolish right To have a resource that you unable to use a neighborhood deeply impacted by the 2019 rent law is Washington Heights in upper Manhattan which is home to New York's Dominican community and was the setting of the hit musical In the Heights it also has among the highest number of rent regulated apartments in the city kenny Bergos who is head of the New York Apartment Association took me to one of the many apartments being held off the market the landlord can't rent it because it's not up to code this is a three-bedroom apartment this is over $100,000 to upgrade when you're talking wiring letter remediation appliance upgrades floor leveling but the regulated rent is set so low that the landlord would never recoup his costs what bank is going to lend you $200,000 to improve an apartment when the legal rent was not even $1,100 The math just doesn't add up we're in the midst of a housing emergency you know it's a shame here because this is an apartment that can house a family another community that's been impacted is Crown Heights in Brooklyn a black and Caribbean neighborhood that has lately become popular among recent college graduates i once shared an apartment here with roommates a few blocks from where I lived is a 14-unit building owned by Lincoln Eckles who is keeping two of his regulated apartments vacant because he'd lose money renovating and renting them out my uncle bought this property in the late 50s and he passed it on to my father he showed me one of his empty units it hasn't been touched since the tenant passed away the city has set the rent at about $1,000 a month or a fraction of its market value this is one of those shuttered apartments some people call them zombie apartments it's locked up as dead the math doesn't work day one I rented i would be at a loss but not all of the units in his building are rent regulated he took me on a tour of a three-bedroom where the tenants pay $4,100 a month however only three out of the 14 units in the building are market rate like this one and Eckles says he's going broke i am closing out the month with less than $50 in the bank account the politicians who champion the 2019 law see the solution to New York's housing crisis as more government intervention which inevitably creates new distortions in the market leading to more government intervention and so on is what Glazer called a game of whack-a-ole new York recently passed a law limiting rent increases for market rate apartments the state also made it harder for landlords to terminate a lease and the law requires building owners to pay the real estate brokers who help place tenants in apartments one of the few votes against that bill came from Queens Council member Vicky Paladino who criticized the whack-a-ole approach to housing policy in a few more years we'll all sit here again and wonder why housing is even more expensive and try to pass yet another dumb solution destined to fail this city why Why do we want it When do we want it Let's start marching everyone in October freeze the rent activists marched to the mayor's residence at Gracie Mansion while New Yorkers going about their everyday lives looked on shut it down zoran Mamdani's plan to freeze the rent would be yet another attempt to fix a problem caused by government intervention with more government intervention it's true as your next mayor I will freeze your rent the last time I filmed at one of these rallies Mandani was a longot mayoral candidate now he's the front runner mhani promised to freeze the rent for uh four years it became the number one political question at the debates it is a a question at the forefront of this election it gives us a gauge of like what is this person willing to do for us and like how far out on a limb are they willing to go if you're freezing the rent that you're willing to do much much bigger things that we need you to do housing is a human right what about the people who are trying to get into rent regulated apartments but you don't already live in them because they won't benefit from that rent freeze how do they get by anymore I don't know about the vacancy i don't know about the availability but I know that there's 1 million rent stabilized apartments and we're trying to hold on to them as best we can for the people that need them who you know have been in them for a long time because they need them oh the rent is too damn high and Cornac fears that if Mamani wins more landlords will pull their units off the market and the entire city will suffer the reality is we're providing a service you can't provide any service with rising expenses without raising what we charge for that i hope that ser voices will be listened to in Albany and that they fix the problems that we see with these empty rent stabilized units let me get your email and your number julian and Zena are currently living in a sublet in Queens that they are paying for with a government housing subsidy as they continue to look for a more permanent home if you don't know how to navigate the system well enough unfortunately it can fail you so quickly we're still doing our best to get to a point where we can qualify for another rent regulated place but again like just depends on who they choose and it's unfortunately not usually us the victims of rent regulation such as Julian and Zena often go unnoticed while those who reap the benefits have the ear of politicians if they get what they want New York will continue on its path to becoming a city exclusively for the rich or lucky rent stabilization works wonders for quite honestly friends that I knew from high school are still living in their parents' apartments rents have barely changed since the 1970s and they're getting a fantastic deal but New York would also be richer if it had space for couples like frankly my own parents who came to New York with much less and were trying to find some kind of a future if you dream of a city that changes if you dream of a city that offers hope if you dream of a city that offers opportunity to people who aren't starting as insiders then rent control is almost and everywhere a mistake free the rent free the rent
